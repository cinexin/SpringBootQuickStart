# SpringBootQuickStart

Following gr8 Spring Boot Tutorial from JavaBrains: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmbC-xnvykcghOSOJ1ZF6ja3aOgZAgaMO

MADE WITH SPRING TOOL SUITE: http://spring.io/tools/sts


To run it from Spring Tool Suite (STS), just rigth-click on "CourseApiApp" class "Run AS.. > Java Application". A servlet container will be started using 8080 port by default

To debug REST methods I used the super cool RESTer Mozilla extension.

We're going to build a pretty simple "REST" API for Courses Management
